  "Text":"My heart's a stereo \n It beats for you, so listen close \n Hear my thoughts in every note \n Make me your radio \n Turn me up when you feel low \n This melody was meant for you \n Just sing along to my stereo \n If I was just another dusty record on the shelf \n Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else \n If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that \n Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that \n Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks \n It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks \n I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that \n 'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts \n If I could only find a note to make you understand \n I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand \n Keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune \n And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you \n My heart's a stereo \n It beats for you, so listen close \n Hear my thoughts in every note \n Make me your radio \n Turn me up when you feel low \n This melody was meant for you \n Just sing along to my stereo \n Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo \n Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go \n If I was an old-school, fifty pound boom box \n Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk \n Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops \n And crank it higher every time they told you to stop \n And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me \n When you have to purchase mad D batteries \n Appreciate every mix tape your friends make \n You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate \n I think finally found a note to make you understand \n If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand \n Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune \n And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you \n My heart's a stereo \n It beats for you, so listen close \n Hear my thoughts in every note \n Make me your radio \n Turn me up when you feel low \n This melody was meant for you \n Just sing along to my stereo \n Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo \n Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go \n I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me) \n Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find) \n I take your hand and pull it closer to mine \n Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind \n My heart's a stereo \n It beats for you, so listen close \n Hear my thoughts in every note \n Make me your radio \n Turn me up when you feel low \n This melody was meant for you \n Just sing along to my stereo \n Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo \n Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo"
