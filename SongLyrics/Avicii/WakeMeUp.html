<p style="color:orange">Feeling my way through the darkness</p>
<p style="color:orange">Guided by a beating heart</p>
<p style="color:orange">I can&#39;t tell where the journey will end</p>
<p style="color:orange">But I know where to start</p>
<p style="color:orange">They tell me I&#39;m too young to understand</p>
<p style="color:orange">They say I&#39;m caught up in a dream</p>
<p style="color:orange">Well life will pass me by if I don&#39;t open up my eyes</p>
<p style="color:orange">Well that&#39;s fine by me</p>
<p style="color:orange">So wake me up when it&#39;s all over</p>
<p style="color:orange">When I&#39;m wiser and I&#39;m older</p>
<p style="color:orange">All this time I was finding myself</p>
<p style="color:orange">And I didn&#39;t know﻿ I was lost</p>
<p style="color:orange">So wake me up when it&#39;s all over</p>
<p style="color:orange">When I&#39;m wiser and I&#39;m older</p>
<p style="color:orange">All this time I was finding myself</p>
<p style="color:orange">And I didn&#39;t know﻿ I was lost</p>
<p style="color:orange">I tried carrying the weight of the world</p>
<p style="color:orange">But I only have two hands</p>
<p style="color:orange">I hope I get the chance to travel the world</p>
<p style="color:orange">But I don&#39;t have any plans</p>
<p style="color:orange">I wish that I could stay forever this young</p>
<p style="color:orange">Not afraid to close my eyes</p>
<p style="color:orange">Life&#39;s a game﻿ made for everyone</p>
<p style="color:orange">And love is the prize</p>
<p style="color:orange">So wake me up when it&#39;s all over</p>
<p style="color:orange">When I&#39;m wiser and I&#39;m older</p>
<p style="color:orange">All this time I was finding myself</p>
<p style="color:orange">And I didn&#39;t know﻿ I was lost</p>
<p style="color:orange">So wake me up when it&#39;s all over</p>
