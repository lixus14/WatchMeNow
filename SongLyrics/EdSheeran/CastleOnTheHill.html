<p style="color:orange">When I was six years old I broke my leg</p>
<p style="color:orange">I was running from my brother and his friends</p>
<p style="color:orange">And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down</p>
<p style="color:orange">I was younger then, take me back to when I</p>
<p style="color:orange">Found my heart and broke it here</p>
<p style="color:orange">Made friends and lost them through the years</p>
<p style="color:orange">And I&#39;ve not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I&#39;ve grown</p>
<p style="color:orange">But I can&#39;t wait to go home</p>
<p style="color:orange">I&#39;m on my way</p>
<p style="color:orange">Driving at ninety down those country lanes</p>
<p style="color:orange">Singing to &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;</p>
<p style="color:orange">And I miss the way you make me feel, and it&#39;s real</p>
<p style="color:orange">We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill</p>
<p style="color:orange">Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes</p>
<p style="color:orange">Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends</p>
<p style="color:orange">Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don&#39;t reckon that I did it right</p>
<p style="color:orange">But I was younger then, take me back to when</p>
<p style="color:orange">We found weekend jobs, when we got paid</p>
<p style="color:orange">We&#39;d buy cheap spirits and drink them straight</p>
<p style="color:orange">Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we&#39;ve grown</p>
<p style="color:orange">But I can&#39;t wait to go home</p>
<p style="color:orange">I&#39;m on my way</p>
<p style="color:orange">Driving at ninety down those country lanes</p>
<p style="color:orange">Singing to &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;</p>
<p style="color:orange">And I miss the way you make me feel, and it&#39;s real</p>
<p style="color:orange">We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill</p>
<p style="color:orange">Over the castle on the hill</p>
<p style="color:orange">Over the castle on the hill</p>
<p style="color:orange">One friend left to sell clothes</p>
<p style="color:orange">One works down by the coast</p>
<p style="color:orange">One had two kids but lives alone</p>
<p style="color:orange">One&#39;s brother overdosed</p>
<p style="color:orange">One&#39;s already on his second wife</p>
<p style="color:orange">One&#39;s just barely getting by</p>
<p style="color:orange">But these people raised me and I can&#39;t wait to go home</p>
<p style="color:orange">And I&#39;m on my way, I still remember</p>
<p style="color:orange">This old country lanes</p>
<p style="color:orange">When we did not know the answers</p>
<p style="color:orange">And I miss the way you make me feel, it&#39;s real</p>
<p style="color:orange">We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill</p>
<p style="color:orange">Over the castle on the hill</p>
<p style="color:orange">Over the castle on the hill</p>
