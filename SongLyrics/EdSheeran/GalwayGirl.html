<p style="color:orange">She played the fiddle in an Irish band</p>
<p style="color:orange">But she fell in love with an English man</p>
<p style="color:orange">Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand</p>
<p style="color:orange">Said, &quot;Baby, I just wanna dance&quot;</p>
<p style="color:orange">I meet her on Grafton street right outside of the bar</p>
<p style="color:orange">She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar</p>
<p style="color:orange">She asked me, &quot;What does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?&quot;</p>
<p style="color:orange">Said, &quot;It was one of my friend&#39;s songs, do you want to drink on?&quot;</p>
<p style="color:orange">She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun</p>
<p style="color:orange">She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding as a shotgun</p>
<p style="color:orange">Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar</p>
<p style="color:orange">Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance</p>
<p style="color:orange">You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band</p>
<p style="color:orange">But she fell in love with an English man</p>
<p style="color:orange">Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand</p>
<p style="color:orange">Said, &quot;Baby, I just wanna dance&quot;</p>
<p style="color:orange">With my pretty little Galway girl</p>
<p style="color:orange">You&#39;re my pretty little Galway girl</p>
<p style="color:orange">You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool</p>
<p style="color:orange">And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room</p>
<p style="color:orange">As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool</p>
<p style="color:orange">After dancing to Kaleigh, singing to trad tunes</p>
<p style="color:orange">I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet</p>
<p style="color:orange">Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week</p>
<p style="color:orange">And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me</p>
<p style="color:orange">You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band</p>
<p style="color:orange">But she fell in love with an English man</p>
<p style="color:orange">Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand</p>
<p style="color:orange">Said, &quot;Baby, I just wanna to dance&quot;</p>
<p style="color:orange">My pretty little Galway girl</p>
<p style="color:orange">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl</p>
<p style="color:orange">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl</p>
<p style="color:orange">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl</p>
<p style="color:orange">And now we&#39;ve outstayed our welcome and it&#39;s closing time</p>
<p style="color:orange">I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine</p>
<p style="color:orange">Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine</p>
<p style="color:orange">As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night</p>
<p style="color:orange">I walked her home then she took me inside</p>
<p style="color:orange">To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine</p>
<p style="color:orange">I swear I&#39;m gonna put you in a song that I write</p>
<p style="color:orange">About a Galway girl and a perfect night</p>
<p style="color:orange">She played the fiddle in an Irish band</p>
<p style="color:orange">But she fell in love with an English man</p>
<p style="color:orange">Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand</p>
<p style="color:orange">Said, &quot;Baby, I just wanna to dance&quot;</p>
<p style="color:orange">My pretty little Galway girl</p>
<p style="color:orange">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl</p>
<p style="color:orange">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl</p>
<p style="color:orange">My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl, hey</p>
