<p style="color:orange">I found a love for me</p>
<p style="color:orange">Darling just dive right in</p>
<p style="color:orange">And follow my lead</p>
<p style="color:orange">Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet</p>
<p style="color:orange">I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
<p style="color:orange">&#39;Cause we were just kids when we fell in love</p>
<p style="color:orange">Not knowing what it was</p>
<p style="color:orange">I will not give you up this time</p>
<p style="color:orange">But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own</p>
<p style="color:orange">And in your eyes you&#39;re holding mine</p>
<p style="color:orange">Baby, I&#39;m dancing in the dark with you between my arms</p>
<p style="color:orange">Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song</p>
<p style="color:orange">When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath</p>
<p style="color:orange">But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
<p style="color:orange">Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know</p>
<p style="color:orange">She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I&#39;ll share her home</p>
<p style="color:orange">I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets</p>
<p style="color:orange">To carry love, to carry children of our own</p>
<p style="color:orange">We are still kids, but we&#39;re so in love</p>
<p style="color:orange">Fighting against all odds</p>
<p style="color:orange">I know we&#39;ll be alright this time</p>
<p style="color:orange">Darling, just hold my hand</p>
<p style="color:orange">Be my girl, I&#39;ll be your man</p>
<p style="color:orange">I see my future in your eyes</p>
<p style="color:orange">Baby, I&#39;m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms</p>
<p style="color:orange">Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song</p>
<p style="color:orange">When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful</p>
<p style="color:orange">I don&#39;t deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
<p style="color:orange">Baby, I&#39;m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms</p>
<p style="color:orange">Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song</p>
<p style="color:orange">I have faith in what I see</p>
<p style="color:orange">Now I know I have met an angel in person</p>
<p style="color:orange">And she looks perfect</p>
<p style="color:orange">I don&#39;t deserve this</p>
<p style="color:orange">You look perfect tonight</p>
