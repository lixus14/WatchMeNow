<p style="color:orange">I&#39;m at a payphone trying to call home</p>
<p style="color:orange">All of my change I spent on you</p>
<p style="color:orange">Where have the times gone, baby it&#39;s all wrong</p>
<p style="color:orange">Where are the plans we made for two</p>
<p style="color:orange">Yeah, I, I know it&#39;s hard to remember</p>
<p style="color:orange">The people we used to be</p>
<p style="color:orange">It&#39;s even harder to picture</p>
<p style="color:orange">That you&#39;re not here next to me</p>
<p style="color:orange">You say it&#39;s too late to make it</p>
<p style="color:orange">But is it too late to try</p>
<p style="color:orange">And in our time that you wasted</p>
<p style="color:orange">All of our bridges burned down</p>
<p style="color:orange">I&#39;ve wasted my nights</p>
<p style="color:orange">You turned out the lights</p>
<p style="color:orange">Now I&#39;m paralyzed</p>
<p style="color:orange">Still stuck in that time</p>
<p style="color:orange">When we called it love</p>
<p style="color:orange">But even the sun sets in paradise</p>
<p style="color:orange">I&#39;m at a payphone trying to call home</p>
<p style="color:orange">All of my change I spent on you</p>
<p style="color:orange">Where have the times gone, baby it&#39;s all wrong</p>
<p style="color:orange">Where are the plans we made for two</p>
<p style="color:orange">If Happy Ever Afters did exist</p>
<p style="color:orange">I would still be holding you like this</p>
<p style="color:orange">All those fairy tales are full of it</p>
<p style="color:orange">One more stupid love song, I&#39;ll be sick</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow</p>
<p style="color:orange">&#39;Cause you forgot yesterday</p>
<p style="color:orange">I gave you my love to borrow</p>
<p style="color:orange">But you just gave it away</p>
<p style="color:orange">You can&#39;t expect me to be fine</p>
<p style="color:orange">I don&#39;t expect you to care</p>
<p style="color:orange">I know I&#39;ve said it before</p>
<p style="color:orange">But all of our bridges burned down</p>
<p style="color:orange">I&#39;ve wasted my nights,</p>
<p style="color:orange">You turned out the lights</p>
<p style="color:orange">Now I&#39;m paralyzed</p>
<p style="color:orange">Still stuck in that time</p>
<p style="color:orange">When we called it love</p>
<p style="color:orange">But even the sun sets in paradise</p>

<p style="color:orange">I would still be holding you like this</p>
<p style="color:orange">All those fairy tales are full of it</p>
<p style="color:orange">One more stupid love song, I&#39;ll be sick</p>
<p style="color:orange">Now I&#39;m at a payphone</p>
<p style="color:orange">Man, f*** that sh**</p>
<p style="color:orange">I&#39;ll be out spending all this money</p>
<p style="color:orange">While you&#39;re sitting round wondering</p>
<p style="color:orange">Why it wasn&#39;t you who came up from nothing</p>
<p style="color:orange">Made it from the bottom</p>
<p style="color:orange">Now when you see me I&#39;m stunting</p>
<p style="color:orange">And all of my cars start with a push of a button</p>
<p style="color:orange">Telling me the chances I blew up</p>
<p style="color:orange">Or whatever you call it</p>
<p style="color:orange">Switch the number to my phone</p>
<p style="color:orange">So you never could call it</p>
<p style="color:orange">Don&#39;t need my name on my show</p>
<p style="color:orange">You can tell it I&#39;m ballin&#39;</p>
<p style="color:orange">Swish, what a shame could have got picked</p>
<p style="color:orange">Had a really good game but you missed your last shot</p>
<p style="color:orange">So you talk about who you see at the top</p>
<p style="color:orange">Or what you could have saw but sad to say it&#39;s over for</p>
<p style="color:orange">Phantom pulled up valet open doors</p>
<p style="color:orange">Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for</p>
<p style="color:orange">Now it&#39;s me who they want, so you can go and take</p>
<p style="color:orange">That little piece of sh** with you</p>
<p style="color:orange">I&#39;m at a payphone trying to call home</p>
<p style="color:orange">All of my change I spent on you</p>
<p style="color:orange">Where have the times gone, baby it&#39;s all wrong</p>
<p style="color:orange">Where are the plans we made for two</p>
<p style="color:orange">If Happy Ever Afters did exist</p>
<p style="color:orange">I would still be holding you like this</p>
<p style="color:orange">All those fairy tales are full of it</p>
<p style="color:orange">One more stupid love song, I&#39;ll be sick</p>
<p style="color:orange">Now I&#39;m at a payphone</p>
