<p style="color:orange">My heart&#39;s a stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">It beats for you, so listen close</p>
<p style="color:orange">Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh</p>
<p style="color:orange">Make me your radio</p>
<p style="color:orange">Turn me up when you feel low</p>
<p style="color:orange">This melody was meant for you</p>
<p style="color:orange">Just sing along to my stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">If I was just another dusty record on the shelf</p>
<p style="color:orange">Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?</p>
<p style="color:orange">If I ask you to scratch my back, could you handle that?</p>
<p style="color:orange">Like yikky-yeah check it Travie, I can handle that</p>
<p style="color:orange">Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks</p>
<p style="color:orange">It&#39;s just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks</p>
<p style="color:orange">I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I&#39;m over that</p>
<p style="color:orange">&#39;Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts</p>
<p style="color:orange">If I could only find a note to make you understand</p>
<p style="color:orange">I&#39;d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand</p>
<p style="color:orange">Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune</p>
<p style="color:orange">And know my heart&#39;s a stereo that only plays for you, yeah</p>
<p style="color:orange">My heart&#39;s a stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">It beats for you, so listen close</p>
<p style="color:orange">Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh</p>
<p style="color:orange">Make me your radio</p>
<p style="color:orange">And turn me up when you feel low</p>
<p style="color:orange">This melody was meant for you</p>
<p style="color:orange">Just sing along to my stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh (to my stereo)</p>
<p style="color:orange">Come on</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, oh oh oh, just sing along to my stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox</p>
<p style="color:orange">Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?</p>
<p style="color:orange">Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops</p>
<p style="color:orange">And crank it higher every time they told you to stop?</p>
<p style="color:orange">And all I ask is that you don&#39;t get mad at me</p>
<p style="color:orange">When you have to purchase mad D batteries</p>
<p style="color:orange">Appreciate every mix tape your friends make</p>
<p style="color:orange">You never know we come and go like on the interstate</p>
<p style="color:orange">I think I finally found a note to make you understand</p>
<p style="color:orange">If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand</p>
<p style="color:orange">Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune</p>
<p style="color:orange">You know my heart&#39;s a stereo that only plays for you</p>
<p style="color:orange">My heart&#39;s a stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">It beats for you, so listen close</p>
<p style="color:orange">Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh</p>
<p style="color:orange">Make me your radio</p>
<p style="color:orange">Turn me up when you feel low</p>
<p style="color:orange">This melody was meant for you</p>
<p style="color:orange">Just sing along to my stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh (to my stereo)</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, oh oh oh, just sing along to my stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">I only pray you&#39;ll never leave me behind</p>
<p style="color:orange">Because good music can be so hard to find</p>
<p style="color:orange">I take your hand and hold it closer to mine</p>
<p style="color:orange">Thought love was dead, now you&#39;re changing my mind</p>
<p style="color:orange">My heart&#39;s a stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">It beats for you, so listen close</p>
<p style="color:orange">Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh, yeah</p>
<p style="color:orange">Make me your radio</p>
<p style="color:orange">Turn me up when you feel low</p>
<p style="color:orange">This melody was meant for you</p>
<p style="color:orange">Just sing along to my stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh (to my stereo)</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, oh oh oh, just sing along to my stereo</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh (to my stereo)</p>
<p style="color:orange">Oh, oh oh oh, just sing along to my stereo</p>
