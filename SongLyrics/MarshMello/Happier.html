<p style="color:orange">Lately, I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier</p>
<p style="color:orange">When the morning comes</p>
<p style="color:orange">When we see what we&#39;ve become</p>
<p style="color:orange">In the cold light of day we&#39;re a flame in the wind</p>
<p style="color:orange">Not the fire that we&#39;ve begun</p>
<p style="color:orange">Every argument, every word we can&#39;t take back</p>
<p style="color:orange">&#39;Cause with the all that has happened</p>
<p style="color:orange">I think that we both know the way that this story ends</p>
<p style="color:orange">Then only for a minute</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want to change my mind</p>
<p style="color:orange">&#39;Cause this just don&#39;t feel right to me</p>
<p style="color:orange">I wanna raise your spirits</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want to see you smile but</p>
<p style="color:orange">Know that means I&#39;ll have to leave</p>
<p style="color:orange">Know that means I&#39;ll have to leave</p>
<p style="color:orange">Lately, I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier</p>
<p style="color:orange">When the evening falls</p>
<p style="color:orange">And I&#39;m left there with my thoughts</p>
<p style="color:orange">And the image of you being with someone else</p>
<p style="color:orange">Well, that&#39;s eating me up inside</p>
<p style="color:orange">But we run our course, we pretend that we&#39;re okay</p>
<p style="color:orange">Now if we jump together at least we can swim</p>
<p style="color:orange">Far away from the wreck we made</p>
<p style="color:orange">Then only for a minute</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want to change my mind</p>
<p style="color:orange">&#39;Cause this just don&#39;t feel right to me</p>
<p style="color:orange">I wanna raise your spirits</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want to see you smile but</p>
<p style="color:orange">Know that means I&#39;ll have to leave</p>
<p style="color:orange">Know that means I&#39;ll have to leave</p>
<p style="color:orange">Lately, I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier</p>
<p style="color:orange">So I&#39;ll go, I&#39;ll go</p>
<p style="color:orange">I will go, go, go</p>
<p style="color:orange">So I&#39;ll go, I&#39;ll go</p>
<p style="color:orange">I will go, go, go</p>
<p style="color:orange">Lately, I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier</p>
<p style="color:orange">Even though I might not like this</p>
<p style="color:orange">I think that you&#39;ll be happier, I want you to be happier</p>
<p style="color:orange">Then only for a minute (only for a minute)</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want to change my mind</p>
<p style="color:orange">&#39;Cause this just don&#39;t feel right to me</p>
<p style="color:orange">I wanna raise your spirits</p>
<p style="color:orange">I want to see you smile but</p>
<p style="color:orange">Know that means I&#39;ll have to leave</p>
<p style="color:orange">Know that means I&#39;ll have to leave</p>
