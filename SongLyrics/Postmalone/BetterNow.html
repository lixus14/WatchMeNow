<p>You probably think that you are better now, better now</p>
<p>You only say that &#39;cause I&#39;m not around, not around</p>

<p>You&#39;re not even speaking to my friends, no</p>
<p>You knew all my uncles and my aunts though</p>
<p>Twenty candles, blow &#39;em out and open your eyes</p>
<p>We were looking forward to the rest of our lives</p>
<p>Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s in your dresser with the socks you don&#39;t like</p>
<p>And I&#39;m rollin&#39;, rollin&#39;, rollin&#39;, rollin&#39;</p>
<p>With my brothers like it&#39;s Jonas, Jonas</p>

<p>I was so broken over you</p>
<p>Life, it goes on, what can you do?</p>
<p>I just wonder what it&#39;s gonna take (what&#39;s it gonna take?)</p>
<p>Another foreign or a bigger chain (bigger chain)</p>
<p>Because no matter how my life has changed (matter how my life has changed)</p>
<p>I keep on looking back on better days</p>
