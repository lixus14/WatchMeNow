<p>[Intro]</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh</p>
<p>Oh,  oh, oh</p>
<p>Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[Verse 1]</p>
<p>We couldn&#39;t turn around &#39;til we were upside down</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be the bad guy now, but know I ain&#39;t too proud</p>
<p>I  couldn&#39;t be there even when I tried</p>
<p>You  don&#39;t believe it, we do this every time</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>Seasons change and our love went cold</p>
<p>Feed  the flame &#39;cause we can&#39;t let go</p>
<p>Run away, but we&#39;re running in circles</p>
<p>Run away, run away</p>
<p>I dare you to do something</p>
<p>I&#39;m  waiting on you again, so I don&#39;t take the blame</p>
<p>Run away, but we&#39;re running in circles</p>
<p>Run away, run away, run away</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[Verse 2]</p>
<p>Let go, I got a feeling that it&#39;s time to let go</p>
<p>I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go</p>
<p>You thought that it was special, special</p>
<p>But it was just the sex though, the sex though</p>
<p>And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)</p>
<p>I got a feeling that it&#39;s time to let it go, let it go</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>Seasons change and our love went cold</p>
<p>Feed the flame &#39;cause we can&#39;t let go</p>
<p>Run away, but we&#39;re running in circles</p>
<p>Run away, run away</p>
<p>I dare you to do something</p>
<p>I&#39;m waiting on you again, so I don&#39;t take the blame</p>
<p>Run away, but we&#39;re running in circles</p>
<p>Run away, run away, run away</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[Bridge]</p>
<p>Maybe you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m going through</p>
<p>It&#39;s only me, what you got to lose?</p>
<p>Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>It&#39;s only me, let it go</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>Seasons change and our love went cold</p>
<p>Feed the flame &#39;cause we can&#39;t let go</p>
<p>Run away, but we&#39;re running in circles</p>
<p>Run away, run away</p>
<p>I dare you to do something</p>
<p>I&#39;m waiting on you again, so I don&#39;t take the blame</p>
<p>Run away, but we&#39;re running in circles</p>
<p>Run away, run away, run away</p>
